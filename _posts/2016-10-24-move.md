> All mankind is divided into three classes: those that are immovable, those that are movable, and those that move.
> <cite>Benjamin Franklin</cite>

I don’t always know what to do. Where to focus, when to say yes, when to say no. One thing I do know is that I must do _something_. I must try. Experiment. Dabble. Try things out for size. Learn. Repeat.

One thing I am not is stationary. That’s the most dangerous state to be in.

Sitting. Idle. Watching the world go by. Criticising the movers or silently abdicating any participation. Either way, standing still is deadly. I don’t care whether it’s due to apathy or fear. If you stand still long enough you _will die_.

We aren’t made to stand still. We’re made to explore. To learn, to grow, to conquer.

You are not static, you are alive.

_The world_ may have pinned you down and put you in a box, but what _the world_ forgets is the miracle that you’re even here, housed in a skeleton, riding laps around a blazing ball of fire.

Don’t be one of the immovables. Life’s too short. Join us, the movers, as we wander the terrain, exploring, learning, growing.

Take action today. Start small. Do _something_. You were born to live.
