What are you optimising for?

If you had to pick one, which would you choose?

Truth or comfort?

Will you open yourself to the reality of the situation and embrace it, or wrap yourself in your duvet and hide?

I've come to believe that the raw, honest answer to this question can accurately predict most of how our lives will go.

Choose truth, and accept pain, accept reality not aligning with our perfect little world, expect hard work as a result.

Choose comfort, and accept atrophy, accept nice stories that make us feel warm and fuzzy, but don't correlate to reality, expect future pain as a result.

This dichotomy shows itself in every area of our lives.

Will we have the hard conversation in that relationship, or will we compromise and let it slide?

Will we question the worldview we were given as a child, or seek answers that confirm what we want to be true, regardless of whether it is?

Will we look ourselves in the mirror, and acknowledge where our health is really at?

The truth seeker knows the trade off.

It feels the lure of comfort.

And truth be told, it misses it, sometimes.

Not the path it leads you on, which is towards destruction, towards entropy.

But the in-the-moment feeling, the self-deception that rolling over in bed, hitting snooze and missing that work out won't really have an impact on your life.

And sure, small blips aren't that consequential, we all have ups and downs in life. Missing one workout won't make any noticeable difference.

It's not about playing the perfect game. Not every season is one of "going hard".

But truth and comfort lie at opposite ends of the spectrum, like the north and south pole.

And us, like magnets, will be pulled towards that which we crave the most.

Our mindset will dictate what we gravitate towards.

Truth or comfort.

Which one will you choose?
