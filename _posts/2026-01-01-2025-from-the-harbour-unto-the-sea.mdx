## The turn of the year

[2024 was one full of work and travel](https://www.fredrivett.com/2025/01/01/2024-all-work-all-travel/), a combination that worked surprisingly well, so much so that it ended with me having over a weeks worth of holiday to spare.

I'd saved a decent chunk of holiday for our round the world trip that began in late August, with the goal of working a little less than normal each week as we explored what each part of the world had to offer.

I did end up working a little less, roughly 4.5 days a week instead of 5, but the constraints of needing to explore wherever we found ourselves combined with the inherent drive to build a great product at Lex with the motivational fuel of a continual flow of great sights and tastes meant the illusive work life balance felt relatively easily achieved, despite the packed schedule.

2025 marked the mid-point of the trip, ending with new years surviving the Australian summer heat in truly unprepared British style by Sydney Harbour Bridge.

Much like the end of 2024, there was a lot packed into the first third of this year, as the second half of our "pre-kids tour" continued unabated.

That productivity boost continued into the new year too, peaking at the end of our trip in April as looked to put our foot on the gas at [Lex](https://lex.page) and ship all the in-flight features we had in the works.

## 🌎 Travel

### 🇦🇺 Northern Sydney & Melbourne (Jan)

Having spent Christmas and New Years at my sisters in Sydney we headed a couple hours north to spend time with some of my wife's extended family.

From there we headed to <span data-abode-room="35eb7265-65b4-4584-9984-c246e7ddb64a" data-text="Melbourne"></span>
<script src="https://www.abode.fyi/embed.js" async></script> to stay with a friend of mine, meeting his new wife and friends.

### 🇳🇿 "Campervanning" through New Zealand (Feb)

From Melbourne we flew into Christchurch, spending a few days in the city, getting some work in and seeing a friend.

We then picked up what was to be our accommodation for the next 5 weeks, an old Toyota Estima converted into the most basic of campers, with a simple mattress and storage underneath providing us with both the wheels for the road and roof over our head for the night.

We meandered through the South Island, with Queenstown, Wānaka and Queenstown being highlights, along with the relatively quiet Milford Sound, where we were greeted by a pod of dolphins swimming alongside us as we took in the spectacular views of the surrounding peaks.

In the north western corner Nelson and the nearby coastline of Abel Tasman National Park were well worth a visit.

The North Island had it's charm too, from the crazy volcanic activity in Rotorua to the beautiful clear Blue Springs outside of Putāruru and the crazy hot springs in Hot Water Beach.

Overall the biggest challenge was keeping the laptop powered and finding enough wifi to get through the day, with libraries providing a haven for both where cafe's failed.

### 🇨🇱 Chile (March)

South America was the pen-ultimate continent to visit (with only Antartica remaining) and had long been on the bucket list. Thankfully Santiago was a direct flight from Auckland, so we started the next leg of our journey there.

We spent a few days in the city, climbing up Santa Lucia Hill and wandering through street-art laden streets, before navigating the challenge of driving a manual through a capital city on the "wrong" side of the road as we headed out to west to one of the most stunning apartments we've ever stayed at.

Perched on the edge of the cliff overlooking the South Pacific Ocean we woke with birds of prey swooping past our window as the waves lapped in on the panoramic views of the sea behind.

It was a tad more expensive than our usual stay but well worth the extra indulgence, it'll live long in the memory.

After the coast we headed in-land, staying a few days in the wine region before heading further east into the mountains.

From there we took a bus through the winding roads of the Andes and into Mendoza.

### 🇦🇷 Argentina (March)

In Mendoza there were two priorities, copious amounts of meat and wine.

## Times of change

A big change during the year was in what work looks like.

At the start of the year, coding was a combination of some Windsurf IDE based agentic coding along with a decent amount of coding by hand.

<Tweet id="1864691643661566239" />

In both cases I was deeply involved in every line of code changed, whether the keypresses were mine or reviewed.

But by the last quarter of the year things had changed dramatically. I initially tried Claude Code in the early summer, but found visibility into the actual code changes (something I naturally care about) hard to come by.

After leaving Lex I had some spare time. [Ben Tossell](https://x.com/bentossell), a long time twitter friend, joined [Factory](https://x.com/FactoryAI) and hooked me up with early access.

Factory's UX seemed a step change ahead of Claude Code, and required quite a bit less hand holding, so I took the opportunity to quickly hack together a new project I'd wanted to replace one I'd built with a friend a decade ago.

<Tweet id="1966269760481689629" />

It was only when Nathan badgered me to finally give Conductor a go, in combination with Claude Opus 4.5 that things really kicked into gear.

Since then my productivity *(read: Claude's)* has multiplied and I've managed to ship high quality on both the code and product front in ways I wouldn't have thought possible twelve months ago.

It's a dizzy concoction of exciting and scary. At times the engineer in me mourns for the days where I was coding everything by hand, whilst in others the product builder finds myself hooked by how much progress can be made in such a short time.

Spending too long thinking about where it ends up and what it means for my livelihood can feel overwhelming, so I spend most of my time making sure I'm staying up to date and being as productive as can be.

But when I do take time to step back, now a decade into my career, it's the first time I've felt that I might be over halfway gone.

## Leaving Lex & the journey ahead

It's a cliché but life is a journey, and comparing yours with others is futile. What can look like going backwards from the outside can be the best form of progress, whilst the appearance of success could be papering over serious cracks.

I started out building my own products almost 17 years ago and have had periods of intense growth, periods of slow growth, and periods where I've purposefully stepped away to prioritise other areas of life.

The past couple of years have been two of the best professionally, working with people I respect on a problem I'm intrinsically motivated to solve with about as much autonomy as could be hoped at an early stage startup.

That said, as the long trip ended and I returned home to London I started taking stock of what the next season could look like. Nathan and I had some chats about where Lex was going and what I was looking for moving forwards, and in the end if felt best all round to look ahead to what's next.

I'm massively grateful for the time we had to work together and what we built, but equally excited about what's to come.

### The urge to build

The best way to learn how startups are built is to get inside one and do the work. Watching from the outside they can seem like magic machines, intimidating in their vision and execution, something that requires relentless genius that only a few can offer.

And whilst it's true that some startups are led by mavericks who seem to operate in an entirely different sphere, most successful startups come down to a smart idea well executed at the right time.

They say that [out of all attributes the most important for startups is timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNpx7gpSqbY). It makes sense too, the market knows what it wants and if it's not looking for what you've got to offer then there's very little you can do about it, regardless of clever the idea is or how well you execute.

That was the case with [Lex](https://lex.page). Nathan has built his career on being at the right place at the right time. From building the first version of Product Hunt, to being first employee at Substack, to launching Lex just before ChatGPT launched, he's mastered the art of being in the right room at the right time and betting on the right horse.

Getting to work alongside Nathan was one of the biggest draws of working at Lex. Seeing how the sausage is made and how to empower others whilst keeping the ship pointing in the right direction has been a privilege.

*Progress* is a *process*, and it can be hard to gauge how far you've come as you take each step on the journey, but I feel a lot more confident in knowing what it takes to build something great.

As I think about what's ahead, I can't help but feel the challenge to build my own thing. To work towards escaping the continual exchange of time to money, and create something of value that's my own.

The future feels more uncertain than ever, it's felt like half a decade of progress has passed in the last twelve months. What's required to build a business is evolving in real-time, but as I think about what it takes, it seems to come down to a combination of a few things:

#### The Product Sandwich

```
┌── discovering what to build
├── having the technical skills to build it
├── getting your target users to discover what you've built
│
staying the course, not giving up
```
<p></p>

I've got a lot of what it takes to build my own thing, the technical and product skills to build something great, but of the four key areas above, I'm only great at #2, and that's the very skill that's being democratised.

#1 & #3 are two sides of the same coin, forming a long-running conversation between your target users about what they want and what you build.

But alongside the skill of doing the work is the grit required to stay the course.

That doesn't mean stubbornly sticking to one path, it means not giving up when the path is meandering and has lots of highs and lows.

[Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned](https://literal.club/fredrivett/book/why-greatness-cannot-be-planned-jiyqf) contains a potentially life changing message wrapped up in average prose.

The core premise is that much of life is far more like a maze than a straight line, with no obvious step-by-step guide to get to where you want to go. Trying to achieve any non-trivial goal by stubbornly moving towards it can lead us to a local maxima, stuck at the closest point we could find that was heading in the right direction, but with no way to actually get there.

In reality the path to greatness is far more about prioritising short-term discovery than long-term direction. Far better to follow your interests in an uncharted area than to go the way you think you should go because it seems closer to the end goal.

The upside of the message is that we can be a little more free in discovering the path rather than proscribing exactly what it should be. The downside is that in a maze you should expect to find dead ends, to "waste" some time going one way only to back track and go another.

It can all look pretty wasteful

Explore vs exploit.
