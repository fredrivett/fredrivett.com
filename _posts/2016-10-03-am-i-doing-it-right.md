Am I on the right path? Am I making the _right_ decisions? I wonder about this a lot. If you’ve any ambition then it’s probably one that goes around in your head, too.

The problem: there is no _right_. We don’t have a plan that we simply need to follow step by step. At every stage there are decisions to be made. Little ones that come together to make up our day, and big ones, that drastically alter the course of our life, and the lives of those around us.

But knowing this doesn’t abate the nagging. It’s still there. Gnawing at my ankles as I stumble forwards, are you on the _right path?_

Direction is important. I might not be on the perfect path, but I can at head in the right direction. There are things we can all do to get closer to where we want to be.

Progress is the metric I’m really interested in. It’s hard to quantify, sort of an amalgamation of a bunch of smaller indicators. Am I making progress in life? Am I using the resources I have been given to move forwards, investing them to get a greater return, or burying them away for fear of the consequences should I use them?

Progress can take many shapes and sizes, but it is something core to us as humans. We should always be learning, doing, growing.

I haven’t done everything I could this year. I haven’t achieved all the goals I set out to. But I have done some important things. I may not have made the progress I’d like, but I’ve made progress nonetheless, and good progress too.

I’m at a different place to this time last year, a better place. But still, in amongst new surroundings, new circumstances, new challenges, that feeling nags away.

_Am I doing it right? Is there something I’m missing?_
