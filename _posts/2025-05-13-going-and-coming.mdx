The oldest story — the heroes journey — is the most deeply engrained. It's core to the human experience, of leaving, of adventure, of going out so you can come back.

Sometimes the leaving can be hard, done with a heavy heart, other times it's full of anticipation of what's to come.

Regardless, the act of going and then coming back is transformative.

Leaving home, to find it.

Returning home to London yesterday after 8 months away, it struck me what's changed and what's not.

Experiences naturally change us.

Walking through the park after a jet lag fuelled sunrise run felt strange.

Old views, old smells, old moments.

Me, the same, but slightly different.

Memories surface with a clarity that only distance can bring.

It's good to be home, but I've changed.

It's time to reestablish what home means, and who knows, maybe even where it is.
