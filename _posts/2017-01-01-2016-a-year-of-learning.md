2016 has been a year with good moments and bad moments. Overall, it wasn't my favourite year, but despite some sadness in how it's gone, there's been a lot to be thankful for. That's what I'll focus on in this years review.

In this review I cover:

- Books I've read and listened to and my thoughts on each.
- How our side projects have gone.
- Places I've visited.
- Fitness update.
- Best purchases of the year.
- A few of my goals for 2017.

## Books
This year Mike and I both decided to try out listening to audio books. I spend a fair amount of time commuting to and from work, which makes audio books ideal.

On top of that I also bought a Kindle and enjoyed reading both to unwind at night and to relax when travelling.

Here's the books I read and listened to in 2016, and my brief thoughts on each:

### Books I've read (7)

★★★★☆ — _Nice simple insight into economics, my first foray into the topic and learnt a lot. An important book that gives a pathway for understanding the basics of economics, which more than ever is a hot topic worldwide._  
[Intercom on Jobs-To-Be-Done](https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done) by Intercom  
★★★½☆ — _A key book for any product person to read, helps to shape how we see the products we create from the viewpoint of the user._  
[The UI Audit](http://uibreakfast.com/audit/) by Jane Portman  
★★★☆☆ — _A nice short read for founders looking to get their head around the basics of their UI. A good guideline and useful resource._  
[I am Zlatan Ibrahimovic](https://www.amazon.co.uk/I-Am-Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-ebook/dp/B00DH4BL4U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1482832724&sr=1-1&keywords=i+am+zlatan) by Zlatan Ibrahimovic

[Intercom on Customer Engagement](https://www.intercom.com/books/customer-engagement) by Intercom  
★★½☆☆ — _A decent book on an important topic for any product person, but a little premature read for me so it didn't quite stick._

## Side projects
At the turn of the year [Mike](http://twitter.com/mikeaag) and I were half way through writing our book, Learning To Launch, and had ambitions to focus on one project, in an attempt to move from simply launching side projects to building a business.

The year didn't quite take the shape we'd hoped it to, but we made progress nevertheless.

### [Learning To Launch](http://learningtolaunch.co/) (the book)

It turns out writing a book isn't all that easy. We kinda knew that before embarking on it, but now we _know_ that in a more tangible way.

After writing over 20,000 words, we deleted almost half of it and ended up shipping the book at the end of March. It [went down well on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/learning-to-launch) but wasn't a project we intended to heavily focus on, and as a result we haven't pushed it much since.

This is a cycle we've been in for a while, one we purposefully put ourselves into a couple of years ago to get us into the habit of shipping, and is one we're now looking to level up on, shipping still, but then growing a product from there.

Writing the book was a goal in and of itself for us, and I'm glad we did it.

### Real Time Users

In June we launched [Real Time Users](https://realtimeusers.bycontrast.co/?ref=producthunt). Having launched 8 tech projects in 2015, RTU was our only tech launch of 2016. RTU was inspired by a couple of comments from [Marc Köhlbrugge](https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge) and [Justin Jackson](http://twitter.com/mijustin).

We built and launched it in a weekend, primarily to get back into the swing of things, and it felt good to ship something again. We also learnt a good amount about the basics of running our own analytics app.

[You can read the story behind Real Time Users here.](https://blog.wearecontrast.com/make-stuff-ff82f78cf5a9#.jtmt05woe)

### Mastermind

I've appreciated the benefits of community and accountability for a while, it played a big part in our (comparative) success of 2015. This year I took it up a notch and joined a mastermind group. We meet up online each Monday night for an hour and check in on our successes and failures from the past week, and what our goal(s) are for the week to come. We also have a rotating hotseat, that gives one person each week a chance to go deep on a topic.

Since joining the mastermind earlier this year I've already seen superb results, with each member making good, if not great progress towards their goals.

With it being our first half year together, I'm excited to see where we go individually and collectively in 2017.

### The podcast

One of the biggest projects we undertook in 2016 was starting up a new podcast, [Hit Reply](http://hitreply.co/). We started it with the aim of creating a high quality, relatively short podcast to help founders get an inside view at another startup, from pre-launch through to scale.

Unfortunately, after getting 8 episodes in, and receiving listening numbers far higher than we expected (over 4,500 listens), we realised this wasn't a good fit for us. Each episode was taking up nearly all our time that week, and the audience we were building wasn't one we wanted to focus on in the near future.

As a result, we stopped the podcast to focus on other endeavours. That said, it might be something I'd look to revisit in the future. There's certainly some benefits to podcasting over other content methods like blogging, and with [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/podcasts) promoting podcast episodes it's an interesting avenue to explore.

### Sold [FoundersKit](http://founderskit.co/)

[Having launched FoundersKit over 16 months earlier](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/founderskit), we decided it wasn't a project we wanted to pursue. It didn't really fit with our plans moving forwards and we knew it would work better in someone else's hands. We reached out to Leon at Startup Foundation in early December and happily agreed for him to acquire FoundersKit a few weeks later.

_note: As part of the deal, FoundersKit has been rebranded to Startup Deals._

### Relaunched fredrivett.com
After a prompt from [Helen Tran](https://twitter.com/tranhelen), I finally got round to launching a new site for myself, [fredrivett.com](http://fredrivett.com/). It's a simple setup, with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) generating static files and hosting them on Github pages.

### 21 weeks straight of weekly blogging
In August I set out to up my writing game, and set myself the challenge of publishing weekly. On top of hitting publish, I started sending a small email to our list with a heads up about the new post.

I've definitely improved as a writer in that time, or at least in my ability to actually write. I now find it easier to sit down at my laptop, collect my thoughts and write a post. There's a real benefit to regularly taking a mind dump. It always brings more clarity to my thoughts and I often find things in there that I wasn't consciously aware of.

I'm not sure if it's a goal I'll continue in 2017, but I want to continue to take a seed of a thought and expand it out to see what else is there.

### Spent way too long trying to do it _right_
Most of all though, [we spent way too long trying to do it right](http://fredrivett.com/2016/10/03/am-i-doing-it-right/). We knew that we had to change tact from 2015, but we ended up swinging the pendulum from "silly little side projects" way too far over to "serious business thing".

We wanted to find something we could commit 3, 6, 12 months to, and spent too long trying to find the perfect idea. This part is hard. We did a lot right (we spent a good amount of time working out who we wanted to serve and what we enjoyed doing) but I'm sure we could have cut out a lot of wasted time. Hindsight is beautiful though, and the main thing is we made progress in the end, despite frustrations on the journey.

## Started contracting
A big change for me was going from permanent work to contracting. In September I left my role of 18 months at [TPO](https://store.tpo.com/) and signed my first contract with [Spoke](http://spoke.law/). It's been a good move for me, taking me into the next step professionally. I'm enjoying working in a small team on an interesting project, being paid to get further experience in the early stages of a new product.

Plus, I've been working 4 days a week which has been a nice stepping stone, giving me more time to focus on our side projects.

## Visited 4 countries (10 cities, 9 new)

### Barcelona
In April, I headed out to Barcelona for a quick weekend trip with a couple of friends. We booked everything up on the Friday, flew out Saturday morning and back on Sunday night.

The main purpose of the flight was a trip to Camp Nou, arguably one of the greatest football stadiums, home to one of the best teams and one of the best players in the world.

There's definitely something to be said for quick weekend trips like this, they're a great way to explore new places and make memories without spending too much time or money.

### Valencia
In May, after the success of the Barcelona trip, a couple of us headed out to Valencia for a long weekend. The Airbnb we booked was new and hadn't any reviews, so it was a bit of a risk. Fortunately it turned out to be a great shout, with the flat, host and location (opposite Valencia beach) perfect.

We made sure to catch a game at the famous Mestalla stadium, home to the steepest stands in Europe.

### Paris, Lyon & St Etienne
In June, we headed out to France for Euro 2016. We started up in Paris, heading to the fanzone under the Eiffel tower. On the day of England Wales we arrived in central Paris early in the day England shirts on show. Unfortunately we didn't plan for a downpour, and got totally soaked. Straight from there we headed to the fanzone, where the fans were embracing the wet weather.

After a few days in Paris, we got an overnight coach (an experience) down to Lyon. We spent a few days there, heading down to St Etienne to watch England Slovakia.

Overall, it was great to visit Lyon and St Etienne, two new cities for me, and experience the tournament atmosphere.

### Berlin
In September I headed out to Berlin, my first visit to the capital of Germany. I met up with a few friends out there and enjoyed getting a grasp of both the historical and current sides of this great city. Will certainly return.

### San Francisco, LA, San Diego & New York
In October Mike and I headed out for a Californian road trip with a few days in New York on the way back.

We landed in San Francisco, spent 4 days in the city and the Bay Area. I enjoyed cycling the Golden Gate Bridge over to Sausalito, a beautiful little town just ten minutes away from the city. Stanford was a superb experience too, a real world class place to study.

After San Francisco, we spent 3 days driving down the coast through Big Sur, before arriving at LA.

We only spent a couple of days in LA, but more than enough time to have a few stories that we won't be forgetting in a while.

After LA, we drove down to San Diego, staying the night in La Jolla, a beautiful little area on the outskirts of San Diego.

The next day we flew from San Diego to New York. With it being our first time in New York, we spent most of it seeing the sights and being a nondescript tourist. A cool city, one I plan to visit again.

## Fitness
2016 was a decent year for fitness. I definitely made progress, if nothing remarkable.

At the turn of the year I'd put on a bit of unwanted weight, so decided to try out Intermittent Fasting. I didn't follow any specific version of IF, simply skipping breakfast and lunch on Tuesdays and Thursdays, effectively creating two 24 hour windows where I didn't eat each week (dinner 'til dinner).

Some people speak of health benefits to IF beyond simple calorie restriction. Personally those health benefits were just a bonus if true, with IF providing a simple way to limit calorie intake either way.

I personally find this method of calorie restriction far easier than more standard diets, as I pretty much ate as I pleased outside of these two periods. Another bonus has been my significantly reduced appetite.

After 52 weeks of fasting, I'm happy with how it's worked out, having lost a good amount of body fat.

Alongside fasting I swam on and off and stepped up doing bodyweight exercises (read: chin ups and push ups).

Having started the year unable to do a chin up, I can now do 10 in a row, which just goes to show the progress that can be made with a little effort every now and then.

Despite the progress, I've still got some way to go with some of my fitness goals, namely to get running and playing football again.

## Best purchases this year
I'm generally quite frugal with my money, only buying something when I know I want it and will benefit from it.

Each of the three main purchases this year were ones I'd thought about for months before deciding to take the plunge. I'm happy with all three.

### Bose QC35
[These headphones are very good](https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless.html). The sound quality is decent, certainly good enough yet nothing remarkable, but combined with the excellent noise cancelling these are superb headphones for anyone who's regularly in noisy environments (think commuting and open plan offices).

The benefit of getting a bit of headspace is hard to put into money. The fact these headphones are wireless is a really nice touch too. Very happy with these.

### Kindle Paperwhite
I've been wanting to get a [Kindle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-6-Inch-4GB-E-Reader/dp/B00QJDO0QC) for a little while, but the stack of paper books at the side of my bed has kept me from rushing out to get one.

In 2016 I finally got involved and I'm very happy I did. The reading experience is great. Primarily due to the distraction free nature of the device, mimicking the paper counterpart, coupled with the portability and a few little niceties. I particularly enjoy the subtle backlight and reading stats (% through book, minutes left in chapter).

### Fitbit Flex 2
The final purchase of note was a [Fitbit Flex 2](https://www.fitbit.com/uk/flex2) in November. Mike's been a Fitbit fan since the summer and with the Flex 2 release I was happy to jump on the bandwagon.

The Flex 2 is my type of wearable: minimal. I'm not a watch wearer so this little device has been a good stepping stone. I'm also looking forward to testing out the swim mode in the new year.

## Looking ahead to 2017
I've not yet fully thought out my goals for 2017, but here's a few I want to target:

- Sort out my legs to get running and playing football again.
- Get a stranger on the internet to pay us a monthly fee for a product we make.
- Visit a new continent.

I've got a fair few stretch goals, and a few personal goals on top of this, but if I only achieve those three it won't have been a bad year.
