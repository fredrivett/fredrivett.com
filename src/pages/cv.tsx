                We hired Fred roughly nine months ago to develop the frontend
                component of a larger application that we are developing for an
                internal client. During this time,{" "}
                <strong>
                  I can say that Fred has exceeded all of our expectations.
                </strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                This being one of our team’s first projects that contained a
                major frontend component, Fred helped us establish the standard
                frontend stack and toolchain for our team, which we still rely
                upon heavily and are looking to use for other projects. He then
                built out the entire vision for the product on a very short
                timeline.
                <br />
                <br />
                His work was done quickly but was very high quality and required
                minimal oversight in terms of code reviews, which helped us
                reduce the overall management overhead for the entire effort. In
                terms of project management, Fred integrated naturally into our
                team’s agile process and was very meticulous in tracking the
                work and keeping the tools up to date.
                <br />
                <br />
                Fred has been a pleasure to work with and has worked extremely
                well with the entire rest of our team. Fred exemplified all of
                the values that we look for on our team, including competence,
                meticulousness, humility, and a desire to do things correctly.{" "}
                <strong>
                  I would love to work with Fred again, and I highly recommend
                  him to anyone looking for an experienced frontend developer.

                I first met Fred when I hired him as a frontend engineer for
                TPO.{" "}
                <strong>
                  It was one of the best recruiting decisions I&apos;ve ever
                  made. I valued Fred&apos;s contributions so highly, that I
                  subsequently hired him to work with me at two other companies.
                </strong>{" "}
                He has a very good eye for design and amazing attention to
                detail. He has a strong product mindset, and having taken a
                number of his own products to market, has a deep understanding
                of the full product lifecycle. He is always thinking about what
                the customer wants and how to deliver the best value.{" "}
                <strong>
                  Fred is strong technically and always seems to be on the
                  cutting edge of frontend development tools and techniques.
                </strong>{" "}
                He has also been able to pick up unfamiliar technologies
                extremely quickly. For example, on the first project we worked
                on together, he had never worked with Ruby on Rails, but was
                able to quickly learn enough to collaborate with the backend
                engineers, and even write some backend Ruby code himself.{" "}
                <strong>
                  Fred has strong collaboration skills and is a fantastic team
                  player.
                </strong>{" "}
                He always seems to get on with everyone on the team and is happy
                to work with people across all functions and levels.
