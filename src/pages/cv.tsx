                  We hired Fred roughly nine months ago to develop the frontend
                  component of a larger application that we are developing for
                  an internal client. During this time,{" "}
                  <strong>
                    I can say that Fred has exceeded all of our expectations.
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This being one of our team’s first projects that contained a
                  major frontend component, Fred helped us establish the
                  standard frontend stack and toolchain for our team, which we
                  still rely upon heavily and are looking to use for other
                  projects. He then built out the entire vision for the product
                  on a very short timeline.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  His work was done quickly but was very high quality and
                  required minimal oversight in terms of code reviews, which
                  helped us reduce the overall management overhead for the
                  entire effort. In terms of project management, Fred integrated
                  naturally into our team’s agile process and was very
                  meticulous in tracking the work and keeping the tools up to
                  date.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Fred has been a pleasure to work with and has worked extremely
                  well with the entire rest of our team. Fred exemplified all of
                  the values that we look for on our team, including competence,
                  meticulousness, humility, and a desire to do things correctly.{" "}
                  <strong>
                    I would love to work with Fred again, and I highly recommend
                    him to anyone looking for an experienced frontend developer.

                  He has a very good eye for design and amazing attention to
                  detail. He has a strong product mindset, and having taken a
                  number of his own products to market, has a deep understanding

                  He has also been able to pick up unfamiliar technologies
                  extremely quickly. For example, on the first project we worked
                  on together, he had never worked with Ruby on Rails, but was
                  able to quickly learn enough to collaborate with the backend
                  engineers, and even write some backend Ruby code himself.{" "}

                    Fred has strong collaboration skills and is a fantastic team
                    player.

                  As the frontend engineer for our prototype application Fred
                  produced a very clean and functional UI that integrated very
                  smoothly with the REST API that I was developing.{" "}
                  <strong>
                    The end result went beyond our end client&apos;s
                    expectations
                  </strong>
                  , providing a useful business function as well as being a
                  platform for eliciting the &lsquo;real&rsquo; user
                  requirements, and it was put together in only 6 weeks using
                  React and NextJS in TypeScript. Fred works well remotely and
                  independently as well as in-office, and maintained forward
                  momentum throughout the project.{" "}
                  <strong>
                    I seriously doubt our project would have been so successful
                    without his work.
